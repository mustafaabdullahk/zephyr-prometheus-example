This repository contains a Zephyr Prometheus example application. The main purpose of this
repository is to serve as a reference on how to structure Zephyr-based
applications. Some of the features demonstrated in this example are:

- Basic [Zephyr application][app_dev] skeleton
- [Zephyr workspace applications][workspace_app]
- [Zephyr modules][modules]
- [West T2 topology][west_t2]
- [Custom boards][board_porting]
- Custom [devicetree bindings][bindings]
- Out-of-tree [drivers][drivers]
- Out-of-tree libraries
- Example CI configuration (using GitHub Actions)
- Custom [west extension][west_ext]
- Doxygen and Sphinx documentation boilerplate
- Zephyr [prometheus client library][prometheus_library]

This repository is versioned together with the [Zephyr main tree][zephyr]. This
means that every time that Zephyr is tagged, this repository is tagged as well
with the same version number, and the [manifest](west.yml) entry for `zephyr`
will point to the corresponding Zephyr tag. For example, the `example-application`
v2.6.0 will point to Zephyr v2.6.0. Note that the `main` branch always
points to the development branch of Zephyr, also `main`.

## Getting Started

Before getting started, make sure you have a proper Zephyr development
environment. Follow the official
[Zephyr Getting Started Guide](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/getting_started/index.html).

### Initialization

The first step is to initialize the workspace folder (``my-workspace``) where
the ``example-application`` and all Zephyr modules will be cloned. Run the following
command:

```shell
# initialize my-workspace for the example-application (main branch)
west init -m https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/example-application --mr main my-workspace
# update Zephyr modules
cd my-workspace
west update
```

### Tested boards

|boards|status|
|--------------|------|
|stm32h747disco|OK|

### Building and running

To build the application, run the following command:

```shell
cd example-application
west build -b $BOARD app
```

where `$BOARD` is the target board.

You can use the `custom_plank` board found in this
repository. Note that Zephyr sample boards may be used if an
appropriate overlay is provided (see `app/boards`).

A sample debug configuration is also provided. To apply it, run the following
command:

```shell
west build -b $BOARD app -- -DOVERLAY_CONFIG=debug.conf
```

Once you have built the application, run the following command to flash it:

```shell
west flash
```

example output:

```bash

### Testing

To execute Twister integration tests, run the following command:

```shell
west twister -T tests --integration
```

### Documentation

A minimal documentation setup is provided for Doxygen and Sphinx. To build the
documentation first change to the ``doc`` folder:

```shell
cd doc
```

Before continuing, check if you have Doxygen installed. It is recommended to
use the same Doxygen version used in [CI](.github/workflows/docs.yml). To
install Sphinx, make sure you have a Python installation in place and run:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

API documentation (Doxygen) can be built using the following command:

```shell
doxygen
```

The output will be stored in the ``_build_doxygen`` folder. Similarly, the
Sphinx documentation (HTML) can be built using the following command:

```shell
make html
```

The output will be stored in the ``_build_sphinx`` folder. You may check for
other output formats other than HTML by running ``make help``.
